5 Sept 20 - PDB Classes

Goal: To determine the info provided by PDB files that may be used to develop stepwise NN

Possible classifications:
  Classification
    Seems like a poor choice, classifications are usually chosen based on protein function and may not directly correlate to specific 2D classifications
  Global Symmetry
  Global stoichiommetry
  AUTHOR DETERMINED BIOLOGICAL UNIT (in PDB file)
  SOFTWARE DETERMINED QUATERNARY STRUCTURE: (in PDB file)
  MOLECULE (shows up in cryo PDB)
  
May need to data mine from actual PDB website as the global symmetry seems most unique but isn't located within pdb file
