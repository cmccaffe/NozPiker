3 Sept 20 - Learning About Keras

This course was recommended by a Keras specific video, so I will begin here:

Notes:

We are doing supervised Deep Learning as we are providing the possible labels (i.e. the protein that is present).
Dense is the most basic type of layer and it connects each input to the outputs. Essentially, this is the number of nodes, or neurons
  This tells us how many parameters are analyzed in each datum
Activation is a type of non-function that helps decide how connections are made.
"a convolutional layer is usually used in models that are doing work with image data.
  Recurrent layers are used in models that are doing work with time series data,
  and fully connected layers, as the name suggests, fully connects each input to each output within its layer."
Our last Dense layer will be the number of distinct proteins detected by MS

Activation Functions
  They alter input data
  Resembles a 'neuron firing'. Decides how much of a neuron fire is occurring given the input
  
The goal of training is really just to optimize weights of the neural network so as to reduce the loss (or the percentage of mis-asigned data)
  Optimization of these weights seems to follow a similar pattern to that for solving a multi-variable equation as described in P-Chem (Thermo). This method involves taking the gradient of the function.
  
 Learning rate
  Too large misses best optimization
  Too small and it takes too long. 
  This parameter should be altered last to speed up troublshooting in the early stages.
