Updated TF_Run to include reminder as it appears the following line is calling to a variable that pulls from our test data (I don't think this is good practice)
   validation_data = (test_images_sm,test_labels) #are we using test data as validation data? We can't crossover like that.,
   
 We have no scaler, may want to add after shuffling the data:
  scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
  scaled_train_samples = scaler.fit_transform(train_samples.reshape(-1,1))
      This may be unneccessary due to the nature of our data? Since we are using images, I'm not sure it will apply

validation_split=0.1 
   splits 10% of the training data off for validation.
   Need to shuffle BEFORE splitting
   Why aren't we doing this?
   
rounded_predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=-1)
   Sets maximum class value to 1 and all other class values to 0 (binary)
   
model.save('path/file.h5')
   Will save model, even in the middle of training so training can be picked up later
   May be nice to add in to get around issues of notebook disconnecting
   
Import warnings
warning.simplefilter(action = 'ignore', category = FutureWarning

for layers in model.layers:
   layer.trainable = False
      Used if using a previously made model that you simply want to train on new data set(keeps weights the same)
      Add new layers after setting previous layer trainability to false.
