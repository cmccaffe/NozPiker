Updated TF_Run to include reminder as it appears the following line is calling to a variable that pulls from our test data (I don't think this is good practice)
   validation_data = (test_images_sm,test_labels) #are we using test data as validation data? We can't crossover like that.,
   
 We have no scaler, may want to add after shuffling the data:
  scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))
  scaled_train_samples = scaler.fit_transform(train_samples.reshape(-1,1))
      This may be unneccessary due to the nature of our data? Since we are using images, I'm not sure it will apply
